PROJECT INTRODUCTION:
This p5.js creative coding project is inspired by the 19th-century modern art movement -- Pointillism --
a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image.
This project simulates an interactive exhibition experience, in which the user, together with the author,
recreates some of the most well-known Pointillism artwork with modern technology.
The look of the final artwork not only depends on the code itself, but also the user's interactive control of
the size of the paint stroke. Since the user's interaction is essential to the final artwork, they are given 
credit on the exhibition label.

TO INTERACT:
- Click on canvas to start the first painting (the music will also start for a more pleasant experience);
- Slide the bar to adjust the size of the stroke instantly;
- After 10 seconds, the current canvas will be complete. The user will be given the choice to save this final artwork
to local computer;
- Click space at any time to clear canvas and start a new painting (Note: if this step is done before
the current canvas completes, the progress will be cleared and the artwork will not be saved).
